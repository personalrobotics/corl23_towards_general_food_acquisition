time lost tracking
    iterate through the messages, subtract time between two messages, use the average to create a threashold
    n times the frquency we expect, if it's more, then we've some number of messages and that is time lost tracking

start time
    pick time where fork is stationary-ish (within some delta), improves on continuous tracking 
        filters out fork on table points, use height coordinate
    pick first few seconds of continuous tracking
    pick when force is on forque and backtrack
