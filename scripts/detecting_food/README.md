Because there will be a long break in this project, these are self-notes on how to get the scripts in this folder up and running again on Amal's Ubuntu computer:
- detect_food_bounding_box.py, run it on the main Ubuntu computer, but be sure to source the ros workspace for tf to work.
- For amal_clustering_code.py, run it on Amal's Mac.
- For visualize_action_schema.launch, run it in the noetic Docker on Amal's Ubuntu computer. The tmux should have a roscore, an `rviz -d src/feeding_study_cleanup/rviz/expanded_action_space.rviz`, and an `roslaunch feeding_study_cleanup visualize_action_schema.launch rosbag_filename:="7-fries-5_2021-11-24-15-10-04"`, as an example. Note that as a result of being in the docker, and as a result of not searching through subfolders, this file only works with rosbags I loaded from the hard drive onto my local computer. Also note that this file has two options: run a rosbag's own action schema, or run a rosbag's perception with a custom action schema (e.g., the result of clustering).

Extracted action schema elements per rosbag, as well as the results of k-medoids clustering and the mean action schema element per food item, can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VfilnM0_ysq5gPiiPlTZTXmxlx2lYzXq/view?usp=sharing
